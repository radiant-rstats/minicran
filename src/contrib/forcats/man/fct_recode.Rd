\examples{
x <- factor(c("apple", "bear", "banana", "dear"))
fct_recode(x, fruit = "apple", fruit = "banana")

# If you make a mistake you'll get a warning
fct_recode(x, fruit = "apple", fruit = "bananana")

# If you name the level NULL it will be removed
fct_recode(x, NULL = "apple", fruit = "banana")

# When passing a named vector to rename levels use !!! to splice
x <- factor(c("apple", "bear", "banana", "dear"))
levels <- c(fruit = "apple", fruit = "banana")
fct_recode(x, !!!levels)
